# ELaunch [WIP]
## Intro
A launcher based on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) and inspired by [UAfred](https://github.com/zhenyangze/uafred), now only support linux and MacOS.

## Download

see [release](https://github.com/zaaack/ELaunch/releases)

or download from [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qXDQGLA) if you in China.

## Requirement

* Linux: none
* MacOS: none
* Windows:
  * Everything.exe for fastly searching files, this is already packed in, what you need to do is not to quit it on tray.
  * .NET Framework 2.0 for reading file icon. Usually this is already installed in most PCs, but in some old system like windowsXP it may not being installed, you can download it on [Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/confirmation.aspx?id=1639).


## Config

> Custom config path: `~/.ELaunch/config.js`

Plugins in default config are built-in plugins, you can overwrite them or add new plugin in custom config(`~/.ELaunch/config.js`). After the program started, it would automatically merge custom config.js to config.default.js. If you want to use platform-specific config, you can add `linux/darwin/win32` fields in plugin config and them would be merged into plugin config according to `process.platform`. This works in command config too. See [default config](app/config/config.default.js).

Notice: after you edit your config, you need to reload config(on tray menu) or restart the app to make config changes work.
## Usage

>Default Shotcut: Super+Space for linux and windows, Cmd+Space for MacOS

Then you can type in app names or commands, see [Screen Captures](#screen-captures) below.

# Install plugins

You can find a plugin list on [wiki](https://github.com/zaaack/ELaunch/wiki).

```sh
cd ~/.ELaunch
npm i <package name of the plugin> --save
```
or

```sh
cd ~/.ELaunch
mkdir node_modules
cd node_modules
git clone --depth 1 <repository url of the plugin>
```
Then, edit your ELaunch config file (path: `~/.ELaunch/config.js`),
add this plugin in plugins field, something like this:
```js
module.exports = {
  //... other config fields
  plugins: {
    //... config for other plugins
    devdocs: {
      path: `<path to the plugin>`,
      command: {
        `<command of the plugin>`: {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, restart ELaunch or click `Reload config` on tray menu to reload the config file.
